# CSS-Landing-page
We are  going to create a mock landing page for a startup in the landing page will have a form and lead to a thank you page.
It's a pretty simple page but it will help you practice what we learned about HTL and CSA so far.
Let's take a quick look at the landing page.
See the requirements and then you can get started and decide what you want to do.
All right so here I am at the landing page.
This is the welcome to the landing page where a startup that does something.
We have two paragraphs of lordship some and then it says sign up for our upcoming launch and at the bottom we see a form that asks for your first name the last name and email and then it has a signed me up button.
So what I want to do is to recreate this landing page.
It has a heading 1 heading to two paragraphs and then at the bottom.
We have this form that asks for your first name last name email so make sure you use the proper form tags for going to be building this and we have a kind of a giant submit button that says Sign me up.
And note that it also has rounded corners so see if you can figure out how to do that.
Also note that it's colored The last thing I want to point out is using some CSS.
We've been able to add a bit of a border to this on the left right hand side of the text content and also on the bottom but not at the top.
See if you can figure out how to do that as well.
And then lastly if you actually fill out the information and then put some random email address there.
Upon hitting sign me up it should take you to some sort of think Page.
So thanks for signing up I'll reach out to you soon and we see that kind of border around the text.
